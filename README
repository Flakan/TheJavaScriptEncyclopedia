The JavaScript Encyclopdia prototype may be viewed at
http://www.crockford.com/javascript/encyclopedia.

The goal of this project is to produce a complete encyclopedia for the current
language and any future versions that might appear. The encyclopedia will be
developed in Cyc, a simple language that was inspired by Brian Reid's Scribe.
Cyc is described in the prototype preface.

cyc.js              A simple Cyc processor
include.js          A simple @include preprocessor
onehtml.js          Rules for outputing a single HTML file
make_book.js        Make a book as a single HTML file

Since ES3 is obsolete and should be extinct by the time this processor is
finished, ES3 notices will be dropped in favor of ES5 notices.
